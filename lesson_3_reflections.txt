When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Anytime you're collaborating with other people. Or you working on more than one machine.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?
You can run git status or git diff to know how much work you did compared 
to the last known state of the remote repo

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be 
easier, and what would be harder?
Shared word documents? passing back and forth zip files. it would be a 
lot harder to track the history of the repo, much harder to do and track 
code reviews, and harder to go back to previous states of the code. it 
would be a lot easier to make changes though.
