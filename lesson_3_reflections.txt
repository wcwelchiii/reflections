When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Anytime you're collaborating with other people. Or you working on more than one machine.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?
You can run git status or git diff to know how much work you did compared 
to the last known state of the remote repo
