omg. here are my lesson 2 reflections!

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The diagrams from the 'git log --graph' command give you an overview
of the the branches you have visibility of. They allow you to see
visually where they break from one another, how many commits are in each branch 
and the labels in each.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the 
diagram the way we do?
merging two branches together takes all the changes that have been made between
the tips of both branches and puts them into a new commit. 

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
Pros: automatic merging saves time because Git is smart about what changes
should stay from each branch by comparing commits from each branch with the
first common ancestor of each. Cons: you may end up with weird code if the
commits from each branch aren't compatible. only manually merging by someone who
knew the whole space would do that well.
