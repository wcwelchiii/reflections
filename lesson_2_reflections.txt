omg. here are my lesson 2 reflections!

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The diagrams from the 'git log --graph' command give you an overview
of the the branches you have visibility of. They allow you to see
visually where they break from one another, how many commits are in each branch 
and the labels in each.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the 
diagram the way we do?
merging two branches together takes all the changes that have been made between
the tips of both branches and puts them into a new commit.
